# DuelSC
A simple app for DSF duel spectators written in C++ with QT Widgets.<br>
Part of me has no idea why they wanted it like this, but it was good practice in QT anyways.

# Building
The app was built with ```qmake``` with a minimum QT version of 6.5, so just loading it up in QT creator and building it is self-sufficient.

# Where can I download this?
Releases page.
